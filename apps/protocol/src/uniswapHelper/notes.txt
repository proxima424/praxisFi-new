Implement a single-path swap contract that uses two functions that you create:
-> swapExactInputSingle
-> swapExactOutputSingle

The swapExactInputSingle function
is for performing exact input swaps,
which swap a fixed amount of one token
for a maximum possible amount of another token.

This function uses the exactInputSingle function from the ISwapRouter interface.

The swapExactOutputSingle function
is for performing exact output swaps,               
which swap a minimum possible amount of one token
for a fixed amount of another token.
